DESCRIPTION :

The Hangman Web Application is an interactive word guessing game implemented using modern web technologies including Flask (a Python web framework), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project takes the classic Hangman game, traditionally played on paper, and transforms it into a fully functional and engaging web-based experience. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts, all while displaying a progressively drawn hangman figure corresponding to incorrect guesses.

Key Features and Functionality
Multiple Difficulty Levels:
Players can select from three difficulty levels — Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level features words of increasing complexity, which not only makes the game accessible for beginners but also engaging for more experienced players.

Dynamic Word and Hint Retrieval:
Upon selecting a difficulty, the application dynamically fetches a word along with a helpful hint to guide the player. This enhances gameplay by giving context clues, making it easier or more strategic to guess the word.

Interactive and Responsive Interface:
The user interface is designed with usability and responsiveness in mind. Players input guesses through a dedicated input field and receive immediate feedback. The displayed word updates in real time to show correctly guessed letters, while underscores represent remaining unknown letters.

Graphical Hangman Representation:
Visual feedback is provided using a series of hangman images that change depending on the number of incorrect guesses. Each wrong letter triggers the progression of the hangman drawing, making the game visually intuitive and more engaging.

Guess Tracking:
The application tracks all guessed letters, displaying them prominently so that players avoid repeating letters and strategize their guesses accordingly.

Win/Loss Detection and Messaging:
The game monitors the player’s progress and automatically detects when the word is fully guessed or when the player runs out of tries. Appropriate messages notify the player of their victory or defeat, enhancing the game experience.

Score System:
Players earn points for each successfully guessed word, encouraging replayability and competition with oneself or others.

Clean Folder Structure and Static Assets:
The project follows best practices in web development by organizing static files (images, CSS, JavaScript) under a dedicated static folder. This helps maintain clarity and makes the project easy to scale or modify.

Technical Details
Backend:
The backend is built using Flask, which serves the web pages and handles API requests such as returning words and hints based on difficulty levels. Flask’s simplicity allows rapid development and easy integration with frontend components.

Frontend:
The frontend uses HTML for the page structure, CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for dynamic behavior. JavaScript fetches words and hints from the backend, handles user input, updates the word display, manages the hangman image updates, and provides interactive alerts for win/loss states.
